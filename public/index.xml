      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is unlikely to be the first article you&amp;rsquo;re reading about the existential risk that Generative&#xA;AI (GenAI) is posing to traditional Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings and companies. To recap,&#xA;barriers to launching new SaaS products have been falling for years with decreasing costs (cloud&#xA;computing, distributed workforces), improved distribution (mobile and social platforms), enabling&#xA;technologies (improved browser standards, development frameworks) and buyer familiarity with&#xA;subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With these costs falling, access to software engineering talent (especially in the US) was one of&#xA;the few remaining constraints on SaaS business growth. Sufficient and timely access to this talent&#xA;became a constraint on revenue potential and also helped lock out the entry of competitors into&#xA;respective markets. What GenAI portends, though, is a significant democratization of this resource,&#xA;which will lower costs and competitive barriers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
